## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Web Audio API for synthesis (no copyright, offline-native, no library needed)
- Init: No persistent storage — settings ephemeral per session
- Init: Silent audio loop + Wake Lock + SW notifications as combined keepalive strategy

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- iOS Safari structurally hostile: no Vibration API, AudioContext suspends on screen lock — must be surfaced honestly in the UI
- OscillatorNode cannot restart after `.stop()` — factory pattern required in AudioEngine
- Singing bowl synthesis quality needs iterative tuning during Phase 1
